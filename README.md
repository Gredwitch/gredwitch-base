# HOW TO PLAY

 - Step 1 : click on clone or download

 - Step 3 : put the "Base Addon" folder in your gmod addons folder (C:\Program
   Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons)

 NOTE : It's better to disable the Workshop addon if you want to use this. I often update this, so it's a good idea to click the Watch button.
